Im excited to share with you my mid project that i have worked on for a week.

I love playing video games , I have been gaming for more than 10 years and im still loving it.
So I decided to create a games finder website where I can search for any game I want and find
the description of the game and the game's site.

[There are actually 312 games]

I have created a login and register page where you can create your own account and sign in.
I have created a search for a game page where you can search for the game you are looking for ,
And on the same page you will find some recommended games that you can check out.

I have also created categories for each game's genre so that it will be easier to search for games
based on the genre that you like.

If you are logged on to your account , you will be able to add any game to your library and check it out
when ever you want , you can also remove it from your library.

I have also added recommended games that will be shown on the homepage when a user adds a game to his library ,
The recommended games will be based on his library's games genre.
If you have multiple games with different genres in your library , the recommended games genre will be selected
randomly based on the games genre you added to your library.

When you click on a game's card to read the info about the game , you will find recommended games with the same
genre as the game you are are reading about.

I have used two different APIs:

First api for the created accounts which is an api that I created using mockAPI.

The second api is from a third party site called Free-To-Play Games , where i fetched all the games data from.

I have used a color scheme for the whole website which i got from Color Hunt website.
Color scheme that I used : https://colorhunt.co/palette/222831393e4600adb5eeeeee

I have also used a custom scrollbar that I got from this site: https://scrollbar.app/
